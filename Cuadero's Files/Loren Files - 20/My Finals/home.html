        <h2>Maintain Work-Life Balance While Working from Home! </h2>

        <h5>Lorenfe Cuadero, Dec 14, 2021</h5>
        <p>The coronavirus pandemic has blurred the lines between our work life and our home life. Here are some tips
          to maintain work-life balance as we all work from home.
          It’s a lot to take in and manage, but both work and life must go on. How do you draw the line to prevent
          burnout, avoid procrastination, and maintain work-life balance? Read on..</p>
        <br /><b>Have a daily household meeting</b><br />
        <br />
        <p class="text">Get everyone together for a quick ten-minute meeting every morning. What’s on everyone’s plate
          for work? Does anyone need quiet time for a conference call? What errands and chores need to be done that
          day, and who can be in charge? Who’s taking care of the children today? What about meals? As you all adjust
          to your new normal, a scheduled time to discuss everyone’s needs and tasks for the day will help keep your
          personal and professional lives running smoothly.Go to<a class="text2" href="https://www.verywellfamily.com/examples-of-household-rules-for-the-entire-family-1094879">Family
            Household Rules.</a><br /></p>

        <br /><b>Replace your morning commute</b><br />
        <br />
        <p class="text">When you work in an office, the ritual of preparing for and heading off to work mentally
          prepares you for your workday. These days, your commute involves walking from the bedroom to your new
          workspace. It can be tempting to just dive into your inbox the minute you wake up, which is a clear path to
          burnout. Instead, start your morning with something completely unrelated to work: do a quick workout, cook a
          meal, or read a chapter of a book. Grab your own with<a class="text2" href="https://www.topresume.com/career-advice/morning-commute-energize-workday">Top
            Resume .</a><br /></p>


        <br /><b>Designate a physical workspace</b><br />
        <br />
        <p class="text">The most effective way to draw a physical line between your personal and professional self is
          to create your own workspace: the one and only place where you will complete work-related tasks. In an ideal
          world, this would be a room that you can leave to literally close the door on work, but this might not be
          possible for those who live in small apartments or homes. Even if your WFH workspace might be one end of a
          sofa or the dining room table, make it a point to pack up all your work-related things at the end of the day:
          a physical cue to turn off the work part of your brain. Challenge yoursel now with<a class="text2" href="https://www.xma.co.uk/physical-workspace">

        <br /><b>Remind yourself to take breaks</b><br />
        <br /></p class="text">Use your phone calendar and schedule occasional breaks. Step away from your laptop and
        phone and stretch or grab a snack. We’re less active now that we’re spending so much time at home, so it’d be a
        good idea to set up a small workout area with a yoga mat or a child’s play mat. Add dumbbells (or even soup
        cans), a jump rope or resistance bands, and you’re good to go! Also you can go with<a class="text2" href="https://nivati.com/benefits-of-taking-breaks-at-work/">Naviti.</a><br /></p>



        <br /><b>Set an alarm to stop working</b><br />
        <br />
        <p class="text"> When you don’t see your colleagues packing up and heading out, it’s easy to get stuck in front
          of your laptop. Set an alarm every day to signal the end of the workday. Sharing your daily work schedule
          with your co-workers is also a great way to establish boundaries, especially with technology making it all
          too easy to reach anyone 24/7.<br /></p>


        <br /><b> Plan for your next day</b><br />
        <br /><br />
        <p class="text"> Before wrapping up, identify three to five top priorities for tomorrow and write them down. A
          to-do list can help ease your anxiety about any pending tasks, allowing you to relax and ease into your
          downtime.<br /></p>


        <br /> <b>Schedule downtime</b><br />
        <br />
        <p class="text">Before community quarantine, we went out for drinks, watched movies at the theater, met up with
          fellow crafters. Social activities make us happy, entertained, and allow us to connect with the ones we love.
          That doesn’t have to stop because of COVID-19—we just have to socialize differently. Whether it’s crafting
          over a video call, playtime with the kids, or virtual happy hour with friends, carve out time for what helps
          you relax and keeps you socially engaged.<br /></p>



        <br /> As we adjust to our new normal, it’s important for us to nurture both our personal and professional
        selves. Stay home, stay healthy, stay motivated, and stay safe.
