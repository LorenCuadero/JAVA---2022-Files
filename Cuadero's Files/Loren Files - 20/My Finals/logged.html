      <h2>Maintain Work-Life Balance While Working from Home! </h2>
      
      <h5>Lorenfe Cuadero, Dec 14, 2021</h5>
      <p>The coronavirus pandemic has blurred the lines between our work life and our home life. Here are some tips to maintain work-life balance as we all work from home.
      It’s a lot to take in and manage, but both work and life must go on. How do you draw the line to prevent burnout, avoid procrastination, and maintain work-life balance? Read on..</p>
<br/><b>Have a daily household meeting</b><br/>
<br/><p class="text">Get everyone together for a quick ten-minute meeting every morning. What’s on everyone’s plate for work? Does anyone need quiet time for a conference call? What errands and chores need to be done that day, and who can be in charge? Who’s taking care of the children today? What about meals? As you all adjust to your new normal, a scheduled time to discuss everyone’s needs and tasks for the day will help keep your personal and professional lives running smoothly.Go to<a class="text2"href="https://www.verywellfamily.com/examples-of-household-rules-for-the-entire-family-1094879">Family Household Rules.</a><br/></p>
             
            <br/><b>Replace your morning commute</b><br/>
            <br/> <p class="text" >When you work in an office, the ritual of preparing for and heading off to work mentally prepares you for your workday. These days, your commute involves walking from the bedroom to your new workspace. It can be tempting to just dive into your inbox the minute you wake up, which is a clear path to burnout. Instead, start your morning with something completely unrelated to work: do a quick workout, cook a meal, or read a chapter of a book. Grab your own with<a class="text2" href="https://www.topresume.com/career-advice/morning-commute-energize-workday">Top Resume .</a><br/></p>
            

            <br/><b>Designate a physical workspace</b><br/>
            <br/><p class="text">The most effective way to draw a physical line between your personal and professional self is to create your own workspace: the one and only place where you will complete work-related tasks. In an ideal world, this would be a room that you can leave to literally close the door on work, but this might not be possible for those who live in small apartments or homes. Even if your WFH workspace might be one end of a sofa or the dining room table, make it a point to pack up all your work-related things at the end of the day: a physical cue to turn off the work part of your brain.

            <br/><b>Remind yourself to take breaks</b><br/>
           <br/></p class="text">Use your phone calendar and schedule occasional breaks. Step away from your laptop and phone and stretch or grab a snack. We’re less active now that we’re spending so much time at home, so it’d be a good idea to set up a small workout area with a yoga mat or a child’s play mat. Add dumbbells (or even soup cans), a jump rope or resistance bands, and you’re good to go!

           <br/><b>Set an alarm to stop working</b><br/>
            <br/><p class="text"> When you don’t see your colleagues packing up and heading out, it’s easy to get stuck in front of your laptop. Set an alarm every day to signal the end of the workday. Sharing your daily work schedule with your co-workers is also a great way to establish boundaries, especially with technology making it all too easy to reach anyone 24/7.<br/></p>


            <br/><b> Plan for your next day</b><br/>
            <br/><br/><p class="text"> Before wrapping up, identify three to five top priorities for tomorrow and write them down. A to-do list can help ease your anxiety about any pending tasks, allowing you to relax and ease into your downtime.<br/></p>
            

            <br/> <b>Schedule downtime</b><br/>
            <br/> <p class="text">Before community quarantine, we went out for drinks, watched movies at the theater, met up with fellow crafters. Social activities make us happy, entertained, and allow us to connect with the ones we love. That doesn’t have to stop because of COVID-19—we just have to socialize differently. Whether it’s crafting over a video call, playtime with the kids, or virtual happy hour with friends, carve out time for what helps you relax and keeps you socially engaged.<br/></p>
            


              <br/> As we adjust to our new normal, it’s important for us to nurture both our personal and professional selves. Stay home, stay healthy, stay motivated, and stay safe.
