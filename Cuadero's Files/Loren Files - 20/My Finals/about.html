        <p><b>About Us</p></b>
        <p>  &nbsp; &nbsp; Our vision is to improve one's work and life balance.</p>
        <p><b>We believe</b></p>
        <p>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A good work-life balance, said Chris Chancey, career expert and CEO of Amplio Recruiting, has numerous positive effects, including less stress, a lower risk of burnout and a greater sense of well-being. This not only benefits employees but employers, too.  "Employers who are committed to providing environments that support work-life balance for their employees can save on costs, experience fewer cases of absenteeism, and enjoy a more loyal and productive workforce," said Chancey. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers that offer options as telecommuting or flexible work schedules can help employees have a better work-life balance.
            
            When creating a schedule that works for you, think about the best way to achieve balance at work and in your personal life. Chancey said that work-life balance is less about dividing the hours in your day evenly between work and personal life and, instead, is more about having the flexibility to get things done in your professional life while still having time and energy to enjoy your personal life. There may be some days where you work longer hours so you have time later in the week to enjoy other activities. 
            
            Don't strive for the perfect schedule; strive for a realistic one. Some days, you might focus more on work, while other days you might have more time and energy to pursue your hobbies or spend time with your loved ones. Balance is achieved over time, not each day.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>"It is important to remain fluid and constantly assess where you are [versus] your goals and priorities," said Heather Monahan, founder of the career mentoring group, #BossinHeels. "At times, your children may need you, and other times, you may need to travel for work, but allowing yourself to remain open to redirecting and assessing your needs on any day is key in finding balance." </p>
